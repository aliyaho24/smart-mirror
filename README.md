## About

This is a React rewrite of the popular MagicMirror! I was motivated to do this because I am building my own magic mirror at home and I wanted to move faster with creating new modules as I am familiar with React. It's also a great opportunity to learn and understand how the application works on a deeper level than I would gain by adding on to the open source code. 

This project has a LONG way to go and there are a ton of cool features that I'd personally find useful that I want to add here. So far, the basic structure is there. Check out the screenshot below for a preview of the current state. So far it:

- displays the weather and a custom image representing the conditions
- show the time live
- generates a random quote every 5 seconds in random places on the screen
- has a draggable horizontal scrolling menu bar at the bottom

I won't list everything I would like to add (much of it will be eventually descoped anyway), but a few future additions include:
- sports highlights interface upon open
- random video guided meditation frame
- an interface to handle input from the Raspberry Pi camera module and allow you to take selfies
- settings interface that allows you to rearrange things
- social media "iframe"
- and much much more!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
